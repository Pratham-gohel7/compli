    <p><strong>Explanatory Notes:</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Mention what is actually manufactured, including repairs of all types, following NIC Code at the four-digit level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Establishment in ‘public sector’ means an establishment owned, controlled or managed by:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>The Government or the Department</li>
          <li>A Government Company as defined in Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956</li>
          <li>A Corporation established by or under Central, Provincial or State Act, which is owned, controlled or managed by the Government</li>
          <li>A Local Authority</li>
        </ol>
        Establishment in ‘Cooperative Sector’ means an establishment managed by a Co-operative Society registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, 1912.
      </li>
      <li>
        (i) Working day should be taken to be the day on which the establishment actually worked and manufacturing process was carried on, including maintenance and repair work on closed days. Days on which the factory was closed for any reason or when no manufacturing was done should not be treated as working days.
        <br><br>
        (ii) For seasonal factories, information about working season and offseason should be given separately.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>
          Mandays worked should be the aggregate number of attendance of all the workers, covered under the Act, in all shifts on all the working days in reckoning attendance, should be counted and all employees should be included, whether they are employed directly or under contractors (Apprentices, who are not covered under the Apprentices Act, 1961, are also to be included). Attendance on separate shifts (e.g. night and days shifts) should be counted separately. Partial attendance for less than half a shift on a working day should be ignored while attendance for a half shift or more on such day should be treated as full attendance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The average daily number should be calculated by dividing the aggregate number of attendance (mandays worked) on working days by the number of working days during the half year.
        </li>
      </ol>
    
      <p>

        <li>in such other manufacturing process as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify:</li>
      </ol>
